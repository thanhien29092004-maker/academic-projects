# academic-projects
This repository contains academic projects completed during my university studies, focusing on data analysis, machine learning, and network analysis. Including 4 mini projects:
- Community detection.
- Diabetes risk prediction.
- Link prediction on social network.
- Sales analytics.

These projects aim to demonstrate my foundational knowledge, analytical thinking, and hands-on practice in applying data-driven approaches to real-world problems. They reflect my learning progress and interest in the field of Data Science.
