## Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL skills using a self-created e-commerce dataset. The dataset includes products, brands, categories, suppliers, orders, and reviews, which allows for exploring various business insights.

## Purpose
The main goal is to practice data analysis and generate meaningful insights for business decision-making. Key analyses include:
- Identifying products that have never been purchased.
- Counting products by brand.
- Finding top-rated products per brand.
- Analyzing low-selling products for specific sellers.
- Determining top-selling products by month.
- Calculating monthly revenue for sellers.
